My work day scheduler homework started as a html file with 9 rows with 1 column each using Bootstrap. From there I made it so what is put in the text area could be saved to local storage using the "save" button. I then used a function to make it so the hours that passed turn gray, the current one is red, and the upcoming hours are green. For that I had to use the 24 hour clock and just used greater than/less than symbols. I then used Moment.js to put a clock in the jumbotron banner.
